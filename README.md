bookingSystem is a program that uses pure Java technologies, with no libraries that uses user's name, cpf, email, birthdate, departure date and destination to connect to a database reserved to booking flights. It allows the user to add a dependant, who needs to have name, cpf and birthdate, the dependant field also has their responsible name, cpf, birthdate, travel destination and departure time which are reused when the passenger fills their form with their own personal information. The program allows the user to make and consult existing bookings using the passenger's cpf due its hability to behave like a primary key, only existing one per person.
